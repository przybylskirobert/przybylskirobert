### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Robert and Iâ€™d like to welcome you to my github

Here I will put all the interesting scripts related to my main area of expertise which is Identity, On-Premises, Azure, and Security
Actually, Iâ€™m working as a Security Architect in Predica Group where I help clients with their projects, from planning, through managing, to delivery.
My speciality is security, in the Azure cloud and on-premises.
I also help businesses with compromised environment recovery.
